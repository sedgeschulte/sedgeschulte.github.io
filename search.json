    "text": "There is a famous expression in the world of golf; drive for show, putt for dough. Does this expression hold any weight or is it just something people say when they top their drive off the tee box to make up for their atrocious shot? To find out if this expression is just an expression or something more, let’s use data to reach a clearer conclusion. The PGA website has the data needed for this.\nThe PGA tour website has a statistics section, and the best way to determine if a player is good at putting is the strokes gained putting (SG: Putting) statistic. Strokes gained putting basically means if a player has a putt from say 10 feet, the SG: Putting data algorithm will state how many strokes it will take to hole out from that distance and from that specific spot on that specific green. For example; Tiger Woods has a putt from seven feet and the SG: Putting baseline is 1.5 putts to hole out. If Woods makes the putt in one stroke, he gains +0.5 to his SG Putting and if it takes him 2 strokes then he would lose 0.5.\nSo, let’s look at the top 100 golfers in the world and see where, and if, the top 10 putters according to strokes gained putting average are anywhere in the top 100 world golfers this year.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nsgputting &lt;- read_csv(\"sgputting.csv\") |&gt; filter(is.na(RANK) == FALSE)\n\nsgpto10 &lt;- sgputting |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=AVG)\n\nwr &lt;- read_csv(\"worldrankings.csv\") |&gt; filter(is.na(NK) == FALSE)\n\ntop100 &lt;- wr |&gt; top_n(100, wt=-NK)\n\ntm &lt;- top100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER== \"Taylor Montgomery\")\npm &lt;- top100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER== \"Peter Malnati\")\nmp &lt;- top100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER== \"Matthieu Pavon\")\njs &lt;- top100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER== \"Jordan Spieth\")\nabj &lt;- top100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER== \"Alexander Björk\")\njsu &lt;- top100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER== \"Justin Suh\")\nbt &lt;- top100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER== \"Brendon Todd\")\n\nputterlabels &lt;- bind_rows(tm, pm, mp, js, abj, jsu, bt)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=top100, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=tm, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=pm, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=mp, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=js, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=abj, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=jsu, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=bt, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=putterlabels, aes(x=NK, y=`AVG POINTS`, label=PLAYER)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Golf world rankings\",\n    y=\"Average Points\",\n    title=\"Top putters compared to the top 100 golfers in the world\",\n    subtitle=\"Being a top 10 putter does not necesarily mean PGA Tour success.\",\n    caption=\"Source:pgatour.com | By: Sage Schulte\"\n  ) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly seven of the top 10 putters are in the top 100-cut line. Of those seven, only two golfers are ranked in the top 50. The three putters that are left out of the top 100 golfers in the world are Aaron Baddeley (204), Chad Ramey (230) and Raul Pereda (888).\nLet’s also look at the inverse and see where the top five golfers in the world stack up in the top 100 strokes gained putting rankings.\n\n\nCode\nsgputting100 &lt;- sgputting |&gt; top_n(100, wt=-RANK)\n\nss &lt;- sgputting100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER == \"Scottie Scheffler\")\nrm &lt;- sgputting100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER == \"Rory McIlroy\")\nwk &lt;- sgputting100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER == \"Wyndham Clark\") \nxs &lt;- sgputting100 |&gt; filter(PLAYER == \"Xander Schauffele\") \n\nwrlabels &lt;- bind_rows(ss, rm, wk, xs) \n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=sgputting100, aes(x=RANK, y=AVG), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=ss, aes(x=RANK, y=AVG), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=rm, aes(x=RANK, y=AVG), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=wk, aes(x=RANK, y=AVG), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=xs, aes(x=RANK, y=AVG), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_text_repel(data=wrlabels, aes(x=RANK, y=AVG, label=PLAYER)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Putting rank\",\n    y=\"Strokes gained putting average\",\n    title=\"Top golfers in the wolrd rankings compared to the best putters\",\n    subtitle=\"Golfers do not have to be great at putting to be a top ranked player.\",\n    caption=\"Source:pgatour.com | By: Sage Schulte\"\n  ) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome things to note, Scottie Scheffler, the number one golfer in the world, barely cracks the top 100 in strokes gained putting. Also, Wyndham Clark, #4 in the world rankings, is the only one out of the top five that has a strokes gained putting average above a 0.50, the rest of them are very close to having a negative strokes gained putting average. Also, John Rahm was not in the strokes gained putting data set which is why there are only four of the top five golfers in the world on this graph. The best putters are doing okay in the 2024 golf season so far but they are not close by any means to being talked about in the same conversation with the best of the best in golf.\nLet’s get into the money of things, the best putters are playing tournaments almost every weekend. How many wins and top 10 placements do the best putters have since that truly is where the money is at and how pro golfers make a living.\n\n\nCode\nt10finishes &lt;- read_csv(\"top10fs.csv\")\n\nputtt10f &lt;- t10finishes |&gt; \n  filter(PLAYER==\"Matthieu Pavon\"|PLAYER== \"Jordan Spieth\"|PLAYER== \"Brendon Todd\"|PLAYER== \"Peter Malnati\")\n\nggplot() +\ngeom_dumbbell(\n  data=puttt10f,\n  aes(y=reorder(PLAYER,`TOP 10`), x=`TOP 10`, xend=`1ST`),\n  size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"orange\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n     x= \"Number of finsishes in top 10\",\n     y= \"Golfers\",\n    title=\"Top 10 and first place finishes for top putters\", \n    subtitle = \"Number of &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; place finishes this season. Number of &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;top 10&lt;/span&gt; finishes.\",\n  caption=\"Source:pgatour.com | By: Sage Schulte\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the seven best putters that made the top 100 world rankings, only four have at least one top 10 tournament finishes. Of the four, Matthieu Pavon and Peter Malnati are the only golfers to have won a tournament this season.\nRecap: seven of the 10 best putters made the golf world rankings top 100. Two of them are in the top 50 and on the flip side, the best golfers in the world are okay at putting compared to other pro golfers. Interesting.\nLooks like the expression “drive for show, putt for dough” is just an expression after all. Overall, the top putters are not really finding much success this year and might want to work on other parts of their golf game to try and rack up some tournament wins."
